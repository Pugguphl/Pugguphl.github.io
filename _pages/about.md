Hello! I’m Honglin Pang (庞宏林 in Chinese), currently pursuing my third year of a master program at Jilin University, where I am also involved in joint training at the Shanghai Innovation Institute. I am a member of the Interdisciplinary Intelligent Graphics Group (IIGG) within the School of Artificial Intelligence at Jilin University. My research interests lie in Computer Vision and Digital Humanities.
I have the privilege of being advised by Associate Professor Xi Yang. My journey in the field of artificial intelligence has been exciting, and I’m passionate about exploring novel ways to create and understand visual content.
Feel free to connect with me or explore my work further! 😊
